"""The LOD upgrade has to fire when a voter zooms. Nothing else in this repo checks that.

This is the coverage whose absence let a broken upgrade ship. `viewer.js` is browser code, the
test suite is pytest, and the gap between them was filled by "it looked right" — so the trigger
fired for roughly 1 voter in 10 in production and nothing failed.

Why it needs a real browser rather than a mocked event: the bug was not in logic that a unit test
could reach. A real wheel WAS delivered to the element (measured: it zoomed the camera and fired
both capture- and bubble-phase probes), and the handler still did not run. Only model-viewer
actually rendering a mesh, owning its own camera, and emitting `camera-change` reproduces it.

Skipped unless all three of its dependencies are present, because each is a genuine external:
Playwright, a real GLB + .lod.glb pair, and network access for the model-viewer CDN — the same
CDN the app itself loads it from. CI has none of them, exactly like the gltf-transform tests.

    HONEST LIMIT, measured rather than assumed: this test **also passes against the pre-fix
    `viewer.js`**. It is a behavioural test, NOT a regression test for the 1-in-10 production
    failure, and it must not be cited as proof that failure is fixed.

    That result is itself the useful finding. The old raw-`wheel` trigger works fine on a page
    that mounts one viewer once, so whatever broke it in production depends on something this
    harness does not reproduce — the ballot lifecycle, i.e. a RE-MOUNT. Which fits the suspected
    mechanism exactly: `{once: true}` could only be consumed to no effect by a wheel arriving
    while a slot was stale, and nothing here ever makes a slot stale.

    The only evidence that carries for the production bug is re-running the live rate harness,
