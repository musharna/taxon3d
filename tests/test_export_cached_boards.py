"""Every cached board the public site renders must travel in the bundle.

Found on the live public instance, 2026-07-28: the AI-judge board rendered its empty state —
"No automated LLM-judge rankings for this selection yet" — on a project that has judged four
paradigms. `Rating` was the only board in EXPORT_MODELS, so the global human leaderboard shipped
and the kingdom and judge boards had no cache to read.

The judge boards are the ones that cannot be recovered on the far side. A human rating is at
least reproducible from the votes beside it, but `judge_vote` is deliberately NOT exported (a
judge ballot references outputs the posture filter may drop, so shipping ballots would dangle).
With neither the ballots nor the fitted ratings, a public judge board is blank forever.

The second test is the containment: a promoted rating must never outlive the generator it ranks.
