# --- subject check ---------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The gap this closes (measured 2026-07-29 over all 130 gallery photos): sourcing selected on
# TAXONOMIC CORRECTNESS and nothing ever checked VISUAL REPRESENTATIVENESS. iNaturalist
# guarantees the first — a research-grade record is a true record of the taxon — and says
# nothing about the second. A great blue heron with a goldfish crushed in its beak is a
# flawless *Carassius auratus* record and a useless reference for judging a 3D goldfish;
# a dingo is a legitimate *Canis familiaris* record and a misleading reference for the
# domestic dogs the generators produce. `species_matches` cannot cover this: it routes
# through BioCLIP, which needs open_clip/torch — deliberately absent from the runtime deps —
# so on any machine without them the species half of gallery QA silently never ran.

# --- composition is plant/fungus-framed and must not judge animals ------------------------
#
# `assess_composition`'s prompt asks whether the photo shows "a plant with stems/leaves/roots,
# or a whole intact fungus on its substrate" versus "a single picked fruit/gourd sitting on a
# table or a lone cut mushroom". It predates animals as a third kingdom, and on 2026-07-29 it
# rejected 6 of 8 remaining dog photos as "isolated part" — including a clean head-and-shoulders
# portrait of a poodle in a meadow, which is not a detached part of anything. The subject check
# already covers whether an animal photo is usable (`not_identifiable`), so composition is
# simply not applicable outside the body plans it was written for.


# --- the morphotype must describe the TASK, not a stricter ideal ---------------------------
#
# Task 31 asks for "a whole goldfish (Carassius auratus)". The first morphotype demanded "a live
# goldfish, whole and unobstructed, IN WATER", which is a photographic condition the task never
# asks for; it rejected two specimens showing a complete lateral profile with every fin legible.
# The subject check is only as good as the form it is told to look for, so an over-strict
# morphotype throws away usable references just as surely as a missing one admits bad ones.
