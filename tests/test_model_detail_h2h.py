"""TDD for the head-to-head record on the model-detail page (`/models/{slug}`, Task 8 / #74).

A rank should feel *earned*: the detail page must show who this model actually beat and how
often. The record is rendered straight from `service.head_to_head_record` — same-paradigm by
construction, ties counted with the 0.5 convention as exactly ONE game — so the page never
invents numbers the ranking math doesn't back.
