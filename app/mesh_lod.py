"""A low-detail mesh to START a ballot with, never the mesh a voter finishes judging on.

Measured 2026-08-01, on the 525-mesh serving pool after Draco (PR #124) and the texture pass
(PR #127):

* median served mesh 0.20 MB, mean 0.85 MB — but the tail is fat: 19 files exceed 4 MB and carry
  19% of all bytes, every one of them geometry-dominated at 1.4-1.6M triangles.
* a simulated 4-up ballot (20k draws) is 3.45 MB mean / 6.51 MB p90, i.e. 6.9s / 13.0s of transfer
  on Fast 4G. Capping meshes at 1 MB takes that to 3.8s / 6.1s.

So the win is real but bounded — Draco already took the corpus from 99.6s to 20.9s, and geometry
is only ~7s of what remains. That ceiling is why this ships as an LOD rather than as decimation in
place: a modest speedup does not justify altering what a fidelity benchmark asks people to judge.

**The invariant that makes this safe.** The arena viewer grants `camera-controls` with zoom
enabled and says so on screen ("drag to rotate · scroll to zoom", `viewer.js`). A voter can look
closely, and at close range a decimated mesh IS distinguishable — they would attribute our
faceting to the generator. So the LOD is only ever the *opening* frame: the viewer swaps in the
full mesh the moment anyone zooms or goes fullscreen. Nothing here is allowed to assume the
difference is imperceptible, because it is not.

**Import-safe for the public web app**, unlike the toolchain it drives. `app.main` imports this
module to name and serve the LOD (`lod_path`), and that costs nothing: the transitive imports are
stdlib only (`json/os/re/struct/subprocess/dataclasses/pathlib`), so the Python-only runtime that
PR #87 cut to 173 MB is unaffected. Only `generate_lod` shells out to Node, and only the export
calls it — the public host still never needs the toolchain, exactly as `mesh_compress` requires.

**Why this needs its own gate.** `mesh_compress.structural_signature` is sufficient for Draco,
which quantizes positions and keeps every triangle. Decimation deletes triangles, and the
signature cannot see that: a pass that dropped 99% of the geometry has the same mesh, material,
texture and attribute counts. `check_lod` therefore adds a triangle floor on top of the signature.
