# full-petalled garden roses, not wild dog-roses. The three `complex` taxa resolve to a
# species-complex — by definition a group too similar to separate — so their curated photos
# legitimately include sibling species (lion's mane came back 8/8 as coral tooth and bear's
# head). Naming the intended form lets the subject check reject siblings the taxonomy accepts.
#
# KEYS ARE ORGAN_INVENTORY TAXON NAMES — that is what a gallery slug resolves to, so any other
# spelling is unreachable dead code (see test_every_morphotype_is_reachable_by_the_gate). The dog
# was keyed on iNaturalist's 'Canis familiaris' while the gate passes the arena's trinomial, so
# the dingo exclusion below never once reached the model; a stale pumpkin entry sat beside it,
# left behind when Cucurbita pepo was removed from the corpus.
#
# A morphotype must describe WHAT THE TASK ASKS FOR and no more. The goldfish entry first added
# "in water", a photographic condition task 31 never asks for, and threw away two specimens whose
# whole lateral profile and fins were perfectly legible. Over-strict costs references as surely as
