"""Per-organism pages — the corpus indexed by its subject rather than by its models.

The benchmark's distinctive claim is about ORGANISMS: how well generative 3D models reproduce a
maize plant, a lion's mane mushroom, a monarch butterfly. Until now the site exposed that claim
only through pages about the models, so the queries the corpus is uniquely able to answer —
"Zea mays 3D model", "Amanita muscaria reconstruction" — had nowhere to land.

Two structural decisions, both pinned by tests/test_organism_pages.py:

**One page per organism, not per task.** Several organisms carry two tasks (a reconstruction
and a botanical-plausibility variant — Arabidopsis is tasks 10 and 14, Zea mays 12 and 16). A
page per task would aim two near-identical pages at the same query and split the ranking
between them. Consolidating gives 16 pages across 20 active tasks, each stronger than either
half would have been.

**The key is the one the galleries already use.** `service._gallery_slug` turns a task title
into `zea_mays`, and the reference galleries are stored under exactly that name. The URL form
swaps the separator for a hyphen (conventional in a path segment) and nothing else, so the two
cannot drift into a second identifier — the failure mode this repo keeps rediscovering.
